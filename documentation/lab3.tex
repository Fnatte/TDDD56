\section{Lab 3}


\subsection{Lab demo}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Describe the sequential sorting algorithm you chose to implement.}

  It is quick sort.

\item \textit{Describe the basic parallelization strategy you implemented.}

  When we divide the work and recurse we use additional threads if such are available.

\item \textit{Show the limitations of your parallel implementation.}

  It's quite stupid. We'll end up waiting for threads if we have a non power of 2 number of threads.

\item \textit{Describe how you made your implementation to run fast on 3 cores.}

  We hasn't, yet.

\item \textit{Show the sorting time and/or the speedup of your implementation.}


\item \textit{Show the pipeline structure you chose for 1 to 6 cores (4 cores for students in
Southfork).}

\item \textit{Show the schedule you used for 1 to 6 cores (4 cores for students in Southfork).}

\end{itemize}

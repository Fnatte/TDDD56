\section{Lab 5}

\subsection{1. Reduction}

\subsubsection{What timing did you get for your GPU reduction? Compare it to the CPU version.}


\subsubsection{Try larger data size. On what size does the GPU version get faster, or at least comparable, to the GPU?}


\subsubsection{How can you optimize this further? You should know at least one way.}




\subsection{2. Bitonic merge sort}

\subsubsection{Should each thread produce one output or two? Why?}


\subsubsection{How many items can you handle in one block?}


\subsubsection{What problem must be solved when you use more than one block? How did you solve it?}


\subsubsection{What time do you get? Difference to the CPU? What is the break even size? What can you expect for a parallel CPU version? (Your conclusions here may vary between the labs.)}
